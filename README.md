# Bandwidth Monitor    
## Description
My internet connection always seems unstable, dropping here and there. To monitor and catch such phenomenas, I decided to build a network bandwidth monitor that fetches download and upload rate based on a given time interval which can be set in the [config file](https://github.com/codekrnl/bandwidth-monitor/blob/master/config.json "config file").     
    
Here's a table of supported time interval extensions:    
    
| Extension | Description | Example | 
|:---------:|:-----------:|:-------:| 
|     s     |   Seconds   |    2s   | 
|     m     |   Minutes   |    3m   | 
|     h     |    Hours    |   19h   | 
|     d     |     Days    |    5d   | 
|     w     |    Weeks    |    3w   |    

## How to Install & Run
Firstly, please run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to make sure you have all the required modules installed.
After that, you can run `python3 main.py` to run the entry point in the main file.

 ## Project Structure 
 ### 
 Bandwidth Monitor stores and caches results from well-known internet speed test sources like [speedtest.net](https://www.speedtest.net/ "speedtest.net") and [fast.com](http://fast.com "fast.com") automatically, and also offers a slick UI to manage and monitor your collected data.    

| Name | Purpose |  
|--|--|  
| [main.py](https://github.com/codekrnl/bandwidth-monitor/blob/master/main.py) | Program entry point. | 
| [/config/](https://github.com/codekrnl/bandwidth-monitor/tree/master/config) | Configuration management files. Currently only json configuration files are supported. |  
| [/measure/](https://github.com/codekrnl/bandwidth-monitor/tree/master/measure) | Responsible for the actual bandwidth measure. Currently, this version only supports [speedtest.net](https://www.speedtest.net/). |  
| [/util/](https://github.com/codekrnl/bandwidth-monitor/tree/master/util) | Contains utility functions e.g: checking for available internet connection, parsing time intervals read from config. |  
| [/storage/](https://github.com/codekrnl/bandwidth-monitor/tree/master/storage) | Contains storage management files. |  
| [config.json](https://github.com/codekrnl/bandwidth-monitor/blob/master/config.json) | Main configuration file. |  
 
### Features
|Feature | Description  |
|:--|:--|
| Collect Bandwidth Data | Collect internet bandwidth results from well known services, like [fast.com](https://fast.com/) and [speedtest.net](https://speedtest.net/). |
| Web UI | You can view your collected data using a nice Web UI, that runs on a local server on your computer. The port can be set [in the web-port field](https://github.com/codekrnl/bandwidth-monitor/blob/master/config.json). |
| CLI | This tool prints your collected information in your terminal |
